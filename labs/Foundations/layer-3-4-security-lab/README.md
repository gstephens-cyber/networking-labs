# 🛡️ Layer 3 & Layer 4 Security Lab — Routing & Network Reachability

## 📌 Overview
This project focuses on implementing static routing, validating Layer 3 network reachability, and applying basic Layer 4 security controls.  
The objective was to establish reliable multi-network communication and enforce traffic filtering rules across routed links.

This lab showcases my ability to:
- Configure static routes on routers and multilayer switches  
- Validate inter-network reachability using routing tools  
- Troubleshoot Layer 3 connectivity failures  
- Apply Layer 4 traffic filtering using ACL logic  
- Document routing behavior and packet-flow paths
