# 🛡️ Network Perimeter Lab — Firewall, Segmentation & Traffic Control

## 📌 Overview
This project focuses on configuring and validating **network perimeter security controls** using a routed and segmented environment.  
The objective was to enforce inter-network restrictions, control traffic flow between internal segments, and verify that the perimeter behaved according to least-privilege principles.

This lab showcases my ability to:
- Configure perimeter firewall rules and policies  
- Validate allowed and denied traffic paths  
- Segment internal networks to reduce attack surfaces  
- Implement NAT, routing, and interface restrictions  
- Troubleshoot misconfigurations and policy conflicts  
- Document perimeter behavior and testing results

- **Virtualized lab environment**  
- **Linux & Windows hosts**  
- **ping, traceroute, curl, browser traffic**
