# 🛰️ Network Protocol Lab — Protocol Analysis & Proof of Concept

## 📌 Overview
This project focuses on analyzing how modern network protocols operate, how data is structured across layers, and how protocol behavior can be validated through practical testing.  
The objective was to break down packet flows, study protocol interaction, and create a functional proof-of-concept demonstrating how the protocol behaves in a controlled lab environment.

This lab showcases my ability to:
- Analyze protocol headers and message structures  
- Interpret packet flows across multiple OSI layers  
- Validate protocol behavior through live testing  
- Create a video proof-of-concept demonstrating functionality  
- Document protocol mechanics in a clear and security-focused format

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies
- **Wireshark**  
- **tcpdump**  
- **Virtualized test environment**  
- **Protocol-specific tooling (as required)**
