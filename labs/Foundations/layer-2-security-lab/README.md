# 🛡️ Layer 2 Security Lab — VLAN & Switch Hardening

## 📌 Overview
This project focuses on implementing essential **Layer 2 security controls** in a switched network environment.  
The objective was to harden the switching infrastructure against common L2 threats by securing VLANs, access ports, and unused interfaces.

This lab showcases my ability to:
- Implement VLAN-based segmentation  
- Configure secure access ports  
- Prevent unauthorized device access  
- Disable and lock down unused ports  
- Mitigate basic Layer 2 attack vectors  
- Validate protections through targeted testing

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies
- **Cisco Modeling Labs (CML)**  
- **Cisco Layer 2 switching**  
- **Linux terminal**  
- **MAC address security features**  
- **Network testing tools (ping, traceroute, ARP inspection)**

## 🗂️ Network Security Summary
The lab environment included:
- Multiple VLANs for traffic separation  
- User access ports bound to specific VLANs  
- MAC address limiting on critical ports  
- Shutdown and protection of unused interfaces  
- Basic mitigation against VLAN hopping and rogue devices  

Key features:
- VLAN segmentation to isolate broadcast domains  
- Switchport security to restrict which devices can connect  
- Reduced attack surface through port hardening  
- Clear documentation of security-focused configurations

## 📝 Skills Demonstrated
- VLAN configuration and mapping  
- Switchport security (port modes, MAC limits, violation actions)  
- Interface shutdown and hardening practices  
- Layer 2 troubleshooting for access issues  
- Reading and interpreting switch status outputs  
- Writing concise technical documentation  

---

## 🔍 Key Findings
- Unused ports should always be disabled or tightly controlled  
- Limiting MAC addresses on access ports prevents rogue device access  
- Proper VLAN assignment is critical for both security and functionality  
- Small misconfigurations at Layer 2 can cause major connectivity problems
