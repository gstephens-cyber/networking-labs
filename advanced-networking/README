📘 Advanced Networking Labs

A collection of enterprise-grade networking and security labs built using Cisco Packet Tracer, mirroring real-world architectures found in professional environments such as SOC teams, cyber defense, CAF Cyber Operator units, and enterprise NetOps.

These labs go beyond beginner routing and ACL exercises — each project demonstrates the ability to design, secure, and operate complex multi-layer networks with routers, switches, VLANs, DMZs, VPNs, and layered security controls.

🔥 What These Labs Demonstrate

Each advanced lab is built to prove hands-on capability in:

Enterprise network segmentation

Perimeter security and DMZ architecture

Layer-3 switching

Multi-area OSPF routing

IPSec site-to-site VPN tunnels

Firewall-style extended ACL logic

High availability (HSRP)

SPAN/IDS monitoring and packet analysis

Realistic multi-router, multi-switch topologies

All labs include:

Topology diagrams

Device/module requirements

IP addressing plans

Step-by-step configurations

Verification + troubleshooting

Packet Tracer .pkt files

📁 Advanced Lab Index
01 – DMZ Firewall Design

/advanced-networking/DMZ-Firewall-Design/
Build a full enterprise perimeter network with an external router, DMZ segment, internal LAN, NAT, static NAT rules, and ACL-based firewalling.

02 – Enterprise VLAN Segmentation

/advanced-networking/Enterprise-VLAN-Segmentation/
Multiple VLANs (Finance, HR, Guest, Admin, Servers) with router-on-a-stick or L3 switch SVIs, trunk links, and ACL segmentation between departments.

03 – OSPF Multi-Area

/advanced-networking/OSPF-MultiArea/
Backbone (Area 0) + additional areas, route summarization, stub and totally stubby areas, and inter-area filtering.

04 – Site-to-Site IPSec VPN Tunnel

/advanced-networking/Site-to-Site-VPN-IPSec/
Simulate encrypted connectivity between two remote sites using ISAKMP Phase 1, IPSec Phase 2, transform sets, and crypto ACLs.

05 – L3 Core Switching & ACL Security

/advanced-networking/L3-Core-Switching/
Enterprise core-switch design using SVIs, inter-VLAN routing, ACL firewalling, server farm segmentation, and routed switchports.

06 – High Availability (HSRP)

/advanced-networking/High-Availability-HSRP/
Build redundant default gateways using HSRP (active/standby), test failover, and configure gateway preemption and priority tuning.

07 – IDS/SPAN Monitoring Lab

/advanced-networking/IDS-SPAN-Monitoring/
Configure SPAN (port mirroring), attach a sniffer host, capture attack traffic, and apply mitigation via ACLs.

🎯 Goal of This Section

This directory exists to show employers that you can build and manage real networks, not just pass school labs.

It separates you from “student-level networking” and places you into enterprise-ready territory — exactly what agencies, the public sector, and cybersecurity teams expect in a professional portfolio.
