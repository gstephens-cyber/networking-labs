📘 Advanced Networking Labs

Enterprise-grade topologies • Real security design • Professional-level routing

This folder contains a curated set of advanced, real-world networking labs that go far beyond basic routing, NAT, and ACL exercises.
These labs demonstrate the ability to design, secure, and troubleshoot enterprise-class networks, similar to what’s expected in:

Cybersecurity Analyst / SOC roles

Canadian Armed Forces Cyber Operator

Network Security Engineer

Infrastructure / NetOps positions

These are not “student labs.”
Each design simulates real-world architectures with multiple routers, switches, VLANs, DMZs, VPN tunnels, and layered security controls.

🔥 Purpose of This Lab Collection

To prove practical competency in:

Network segmentation

Perimeter security

Enterprise routing protocols

Layer-3 switching

DMZ architectures

Firewall-style ACL logic

VPN encryption

Traffic inspection / monitoring

Redundancy and high availability

Each lab includes:

Detailed topology

Step-by-step configuration

Verification commands

Packet Tracer file (.pkt)

Written explanation of design & intent

📁 Lab Index

The following advanced labs are included (or will be):

1. DMZ Firewall Architecture (DMZ-Firewall-Design/)

A full enterprise perimeter network including:

Public-facing web server (DMZ)

Internal LAN

Management network

Edge router

DMZ router

Internal router

NAT, static NAT

Inbound/outbound ACLs

DMZ → LAN isolation

This is a real-world security architecture.

2. Enterprise VLAN Segmentation (Enterprise-VLAN-Segmentation/)

Multi-VLAN, multi-switch design with:

Finance VLAN

HR VLAN

Guest VLAN

Server VLAN

Admin VLAN

Router-on-a-stick

Trunk links

L3 switching (SVIs)

ACLs enforcing VLAN boundaries

A core portfolio lab for network security.

3. OSPF Multi-Area Routing (OSPF-MultiArea/)

Includes:

Backbone (Area 0)

Stub or Totally Stubby Areas

Inter-area route summarization

Route filtering

Shows real routing design skill.

4. IPSec Site-to-Site VPN (Site-to-Site-VPN-IPSec/)

Simulates encrypted connectivity between remote sites:

ISAKMP Phase 1

IPSec Phase 2

Crypto ACL

Transform sets

Tunnel verification commands

Strong portfolio piece for cyber roles.

5. L3 Core Switching & ACL Security (L3-Core-Switching/)

Enterprise switching concepts:

L3 core switch

Inter-VLAN routing

Server farm segmentation

ACL filtering policies

Gateway-on-a-stick vs. SVI comparisons

6. High Availability (HSRP) (High-Availability-HSRP/)

Includes:

Redundant default gateway

Active/standby configuration

Failover verification

Priority & preemption

Shows understanding of enterprise failover.

7. IDS/SPAN Monitoring Lab (IDS-SPAN-Monitoring/)

Simulates network monitoring:

SPAN port

Sniffer PC

Packet captures

Malicious traffic examples

ACL-based mitigation

Strong SOC-analysis demonstration.

🛠 Technology Used in Advanced Labs

These labs include:

Cisco 1941/2911 routers (with HWIC-2T modules)

Cisco 2960 access switches

Cisco 3560/Multilayer switches (where supported)

Serial WAN links

VLAN trunking

Layer-3 SVIs

OSPF, static routing, ACLs

NAT, PAT, static NAT

VPN configurations

DMZ perimeter rules

Packet captures and SPAN configuration

All labs are designed in Cisco Packet Tracer for accessibility, but follow real-world network design standards.
